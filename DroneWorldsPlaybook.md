1.  A “Qualifier Event” is defined as a significant and nationally publicized multirotor racing event held in your country. It should have a strong or majority consensus amongst the drone racing community and recognized as your main national event. It is highly recommended that it is sanctioned by the model aviation organization in your country. 

    **Example:** In the USA, The [Academy of Model Aeronautics](http://www.modelaircraft.org/) and [Drone Pilots Federation](http://www.dronepilotsfederation.org) are community based organizations that sanction drone racing.  These organizations provide counsel, advice, safety and operation rules & regulations, insurance, etc. In some cases, your organization may help in finding financial assistance for pilots to travel to the World Championships.

2.  A Qualifier Event will define that country’s best and top pilots for each World Drone Racing Championships within each category. 

3.  Each country may officially send five (5) individual competitors and one (1) team for each Class Category, if marked as Individual and Team eligible. Team only events currently are defined as a team of up to 5 members.  Currently there are Four Classes: 

        a.  250 Class multirotor (Individual, Team)
        b.  500 Class multirotor  (Team)

5.  Races should be open, available and accessible to all pilots in your country. If you have a large geographical area, then you should consider holding multiple races and distribute your pilot allocations.

    **Example:** UK is holding one race in Britain (3 pilots will be defined), and one in Scotland (2 pilots will be defined)
